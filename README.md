Game of rock paper scissors
12/03/23:
Going to make a basic console version of this game. then later I will build some graphics on top;
1. made a getComputerChoice() function to randomize paper scissors rock. using getRandomInt(max) which is a helper function found online
2. made playRound( Player, Computer) function that plays one round of the game and returns a win, lose or draw message
3. made a Game() function that plays 5 rounds of the game and if you win, draw or lose 3 or more games that is the outcome respectively
